# Netflix-diversification-trend-analysis

## Overview

This project analyses the geographic distribution of Netflix content between 2010 and 2021 to evaluate concentration risk and diversification trends across production regions.

### The objective is to assess:

Country-level production concentration

Structural shifts between US and non-US output

Regional differences in content composition

## Data

Source: Public Kaggle dataset (~9,000 titles)

Key variables: country, type (Movie/TV), release year

Data cleaning included:

Extraction of primary country

Construction of US vs non-US binary indicator

Regional grouping for aggregation

## Methodology

Country-level aggregation

Time-series analysis (2010–2021)

Comparative regional composition analysis

Visualisation using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)

## Key Findings

Production output is highly concentrated in a small number of countries.

Non-US content grew significantly between 2014–2018, reducing geographic concentration.

East Asia exhibits a higher relative share of television series compared to other regions.

The United States remains movie-dominant.
